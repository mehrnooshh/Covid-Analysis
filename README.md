# Covid-Analysis
Analyzing the data related to the Covid 19 pandemic, including but not limited to vaccinations, casualties, and more.

# Overview
We imported a CSV of open data on Covid 19 pandemic into a MySQL database and ran multiple queries to extract descriptive statics from it. We practiced creating temporary tables, views, window functions (PARTITION BY), and more. We then used MySQL connector in Microsoft Power BI to create a report and publish it on the web.

# Context
This is a project that I built as a showcase of Bower BI and SQL capabilities.

+ Project Scale: One week
+ Analytics based on the Covid 19 data from Jan 2020 to April 2021.
